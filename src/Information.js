I wanted to make races that were very different from humans, rather than just having pointy ears or a stout stature. (I'm oversimplifying, and I do enjoy typical fantasy races, but I love making new, unique people even more.) So, these races that I've made try to be unique in intriguing ways while not feeling alien to people who live in a world where some of the most prominent features that set us apart are height and skin tone.`,

                `The ramu also typically live nomadic lifestyles, moving from place to place. Freedom to move, choose, and express themselves are all things they value highly. A spirit of adventure and discovery calls to them, driving them to roam, even dispite the dangers of the wilds.`,
                `Ramu are typically healthy and strong, allowing them to live for as long as 120 years. However, due to the unstable nature of life on the move and the threats of the world away from civilization, their typical lifespans are usually much shorter; most of them die in their 70s. Maturity progresses quickly for raman adolescents, and can happen at any time throughout their teenage years. Some youths are fully matured when others are just beginning to start the process. The effects of old age usually begin to occur when they reach their late 60s or 70s. Old ramu that can't keep up with their nomadic tribes will often join a nearby friendly settlement of another community to rest from a life of travel.`,
