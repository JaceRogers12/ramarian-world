                `Ramu are typically healthy and strong, allowing them to live for as long as 120 years. However, due to the unstable nature of life on the move and the threats of the world away from civilization, their typical lifespans are usually much shorter; most of them die in their 70s. Maturity progresses quickly for raman adolescents, and can happen at any time throughout their teenage years. Some youths are fully matured when others are just beginning to start the process. The effects of old age usually begin to occur when they reach their late 60s or 70s. Old ramu that can't keep up with their nomadic tribes will often join a nearby friendly settlement of another community to rest from a life of travel.`,

Many marden have horns or some form of tusks, though very few have both. Their skin is rough and hard like that of a rhinocerous. Their physical builds feature broad shoulders, thick chests, and sturdy legs. The knuckles on their fists form sharp, brutal points.`,

They often style their hair in a viking fashion or leaving it to naturally develop into a fiece mane.
