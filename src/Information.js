                `The government in Orsira is a representative democracy, with a ruling council of 7 members. Each member is in power for 7 years. Every year, one member is replaced. This keeps the government dynamic, while avoiding siginificant changes over a short period of time.`,

Goods come from all over Ramaria (but mostly from the western region) and go back out all across the continent. Trade is always booming.

The whole country is replete with works of wonder to amaze all of the senses. Food, drink, cloth, incense, music, plays, speeches, tattoos, massages, statues, and all other sorts of creations abound.`,
                `The people of Ayu wear bright, colorful clothing that compliments jaian hair, skin, and eyes. Ribbons are delighted across the country (or are at least presently in fashion) and they adorn the people in all sorts of ways. Not only that, but people decorate their shops and homes with ribbons. They drape from the eaves, they hang from the windows, they stretch between rooftops, and they flutter and dance with every breeze.`,
                `Ayu has bountiful trade with other countries. They ship their arts, magical items, and most especially their unique, rich dyes.`,
                `Zu is the language of Ayu. It has many open, vowel sounds, like an opera. The script is delicate and detailed. While beautiful, it takes time and effort to write. There are many nuanced words in Zu that mean nearly the same thing with slight variations. About one fifth of the population speaks the common Merchant's Tongue (Mertun), particularly traders, shopkeeps, and diplomats.`,
                `The food in Ayu is very diverse. They have many spices and flavors, but they have a special love for their sweets. Honeys, cinnamon, syrups, candies, creams, and pastries are very popular. The savory foods are usually very saucy, and pasta and noodles are very common. Traditionally, people don't cook at home, they always eat out. Some eateries are high quality for taste or appearance, while others mass produce food for a quick and easy meal.`,
                `The Ayu clothing is mostly loose and clothy, like kimonos, harem pants, dresses, skirts, kilts, and robes. Their poofy clothing is contrasted by tight things, like waist sashes, short tights, arm or leg wraps, or cinches.`,
                `Most jaian structures have curving features, such as sloping roofs, domed houses, curving walls, or arches.`,
                `Ayu is ruled by a dynasty. The ruling king or queen will select a blood heir to the throne. Usually a son or daughter, sometimes a brother or sister, and rarely a niece or nephew.`,
                `The dominant religion in Ayu is the worship of the Heart Song. They give her offerings of flowers, and works of art, and ask her to bless their magic, creativity, and emotional wellbeing. While other religions are practiced in Ayu, including spiritualism and followers of the dragon philosophies, they are practiced by a minority.`,
                `To greet people formally or respectfully, people touch their closed fingertips to their chest, then lower them in front of them to bare their forearms with open hands. People more familiar with each other will sometimes greet each other by touching forearms, either with the backs of their forearms or the insides my making an arm-hugging-motion.

The castle sits atop the cliffs' peak, overlooking the waters, city, and town below. Near the castle is the great colosseum, one of Mardenda's architectural marvels. Less significant, but more visible, a bridge spans all the way across the mouth of the bay, connecting the high cliff to a tall tower that stretches up from the nearby town.`,
                `The city is walled all around, as well as the town. Docks greet boats in the bay. Descending down the cliffs' sloping backside are houses that descend in class along with the elevation. On the steepest portion of this slope, off to one side, is a winding switchback tangled in a mess of ramshackle homes of the poor that cling to the angled land. Business and mercentile districts fill the roads nearest to the docks. Spaced evenly along the wall, forts defend important locations.`,
                `Mardenda is nearly a city-state. It is comprised mostly of one large city, but there are other, smaller outlying settlements beyond that are also part of the country. Most of the settlements are farming villages, ranches, and plantations to feed the main city. However, they're usually overlooked as part of the country.`,
                `Mardenda has an autocratic ruler, a man with absolute power over his country and no accountability. The throne is passed on from father to son. He controls the country through military might. He relies on people called enforcers to execute his will. They are influential and powerful, and to many, dangerous. All people avoid crossing them.`,
                `The upper class positions are held by the military. Being in Mardenda's military is highly desired, for the social position, as well as the reputation. Mardenda's military is regarded as the strongest fighting force in Ramaria. The middle class is quite small, while the lower class is very large and work in hard labor alongside mardendan slaves.`,
                `The popular belief in Mardenda is that there are several gods, but all are inferior subjects of the Mighty Queen, the goddess they worship. It is also commonly believed that their government was established by her hand. The king, however, is not necessarily a divinely appointed ruler.`,
                `Mardenda is known throughout Ramaria for its competitions. The people use combat as a sport for glory. The most famous is an annual tournament called the Glory Trials, which is treated like a holiday. The victor of the Glory Trials is named the Mighty Queen's Champion.`,
                `Mardendans greet each other by gripping each other's right shoulders with their right hands. It's like a handshake. Instead of waving, Mardendans tap their right fist to their left breast, while maintaining eye contact.`,

Magical ability can be compared to fitness. Some people are naturally more athletic than others, but effort and practice can develop people's abilities and expand their capacities. People's magic usually develops around the same time as their bodies, meaning that youths have very little magical ability, but adults' powers are fully matured.`,

                `Each haltana's gemstone is unique. Each one has a pattern like frozen lightning inside and their colors are all different. They vibrate and are warm to the touch. When placed in any still body of water, they emit a soft, particular sound, like a song.`,

                `Terrors are the most terrifying creatures in Ramaria. They dwell only in the darkness, and are all violent in nature. These two behaviors alone make them a challenge to research. In the sunlight, they turn into smoke, and when night falls, they seem to appear out of nowhere. They reproduce by killing other creatures. After a period of time, the killed creature transforms, mutating into a new monstrosity. When a terror dies, they rapidly decompose into a pool of black sludge.`,
                `Among the more well known types of terrors are predators, snares, shells, and stalkers. Though several other types exist, very little is known about them.`,
                `Predators are generally wolf-like. Their snouts are longer and filled with sharp teeth that drip a dark fluid. They don't have eyes, nor fur. Their pale skin is left exposed, and clings tightly to their gaunt bodies. Predators are clever hunters, relying on ambushes and pack tactics to overwhelm their prey. It is commonly believed that they actually can smell fear.`,
                `Snares look like dead trees, and sometimes the trees around them are dead as well. They don't move, and they only attack at night. When they do strike, they use long, thin tendrils to immobilize their prey. Once captured, they inject their victims with a dark, ink-like fluid.`,
                `Shells seem to be made from mutated people. They retain their generally humanoid figure, but undergo dramatic changes. Their skin pales, their hair will often fall out, their eyes and nose shrivel away, and their mouthes seal over. They have psychic powers that they use intelligently to manipulate, torment, and confuse their victims. They often target sleeping individuals, and the more powerful among them can make a person unsure whether they are dreaming or awake.`,

                `The dragons in Ramaria are not like the dragons of earth. They look like lions, but with more canine features. Their manes and tails, as well as places along their legs, have cascades of magical energy around them. The magic looks like a cosmic waterfall and streams behind them as they fly, which is done through magic- they don't have wings.`,
                `There is a challenge sacred to the dragons. While many of them attempt the challenge, very few succeed. Those who do become elder dragons (which is a title, rather than an indication of age). Elder dragons grow much larger, live far longer, and gain incredible powers. They are the masters of their race and among the most powerful creatures in the world. Some believe that elder dragons are capable of granting wishes. The dragons who fail the challenge, however, often leave permenantly handicapped, if they escape at all.`,
                `Dragons live for 400 years, maturing steadily during the first 80, and are socially recognized as adults after their first century. They usually have very few offspring, between 0 and 3, during their adult lives. Each cub is rare and is considered a blessing by all dragons.`,
                `Dragons are usually found in pairs. Where there is one dragon, another is likely close by. These companionships are sometimes friends, sometimes mates, and sometimes a mentor and a student. Regardless of the relationship, they offer each other counsel, protection, and company.`,
                `Dragons do not worship gods or goddesses. However, many dragons do still practice religion. They discuss and worship philosophies, ideals, the universe, balance, and fate without personifying them. Instead, they accept them as they are and try to gain a deeper understanding of such subjects and their personal place within these larger entities.`,
