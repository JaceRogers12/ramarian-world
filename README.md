Hi, I'm Jace and I've made a website about a fantasy world I created.
I'm very new to software engineering (that's probably very apparent)
but I thought I'd see what I could brew up on my own without building off of one of my school's projects.
Anyway, it's been a good learning experience.
The deployed website can be found at https://ramarian-world.vercel.app.

To Do:
Fix webite to be pretty on mobile browsers.
Write tests.
Add more pictures.
Add an onClick to images to make them grow and shrink or mouseover to zoom.
Add more info (particularly about creatures).
Clean out all of the dumb pre-generated clutter (find out what's actually needed, first).
Create a real database.
Maybe add more interactive features?
Maybe add profile functionality?
