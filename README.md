Hi, I'm Jace and I've made a website about a fantasy world I created.
I'm very new to software engineering (that's probably very apparent)
but I thought I'd see what I could brew up on my own without building off of one of my school's projects.
Anyway, it's been a good learning experience.
The deployed website can be found at https://ramarian-world.vercel.app.

To Do:
Fix webite to be pretty on mobile browsers.
Write tests.
Create a real database? Maybe just a mock server?
Add more pictures.
Add an onClick to images to make them grow and shrink or mouseover to zoom.
Add more info (particularly about creatures).
Maybe add more interactive features?
Maybe add profile functionality?
